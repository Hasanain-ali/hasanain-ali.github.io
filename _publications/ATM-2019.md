excerpt: 'The goal of this work is to minimize missed connections due to arrival delays at airports. I quantified the impact of operational uncertainties on passenger connections using Singapore Changi International Airport Terminal 4 layout and six month ADS-B data. ADS-B technology relies upon aircraft avionics, a constellation of GPS satellites, and a network of ground stations. In it, aircraft position is first determined by on-board satellite navigation systems. This information is then broadcasted by the ADS-B transponder (attached with aircraft) to be picked up by ADSB receivers on the ground. ADS-B data of aircraft movements (13,812 departures and 13,403 arrivals) to and from Changi airport was analysed in this study. The analysis helped to learn and thereafter simulate gate arrival and departure delays. By maintaining the flight turnaround time at 50 min, minimum connection time at 60 min and by containing arrival delays within 70% of the current delay spread at Terminal 4, transfer passenger missed connections can be prevented for almost all flights.'

Low cost carriers usually operate from budget terminals which are designed for quick aircraft turnaround, faster passenger connections with minimal inter-gate passenger transfer times. Such operations are highly sensitive to factors such as aircraft delays, turnaround time and flight connection time and may lead to missed connections for transfer passengers.
In this paper we propose a framework to analyze the effect of turnaround times, minimum connection times and stochastic
delays on missed connections of self-connecting passengers. We use Singapore Changi Airport budget terminal as a case study to demonstrate the impact of operational uncertainties on these passenger connections, considering an optimal gate assignment and using heuristic search for both scheduled arrivals and departures. Results show that the chances of missed connections can be significantly reduced by operationally maintaining higher turnaround time and minimum connection time and by bringing down delays at the airport. Specifically by maintaining the flight turnaround time at 50 min, minimum connection time at 60 min and by containing arrival delays within 70% of the current delay spread, transfer passenger missed connections can be prevented for almost all the flights. The gate assignment framework adopted in this study may also help to identify the gates which are more prone to missed connections given operational uncertainties and different flight scenarios.
