permalink: /publication/Access-2019
excerpt: 'The goal of this work is to minimize missed connections due to arrival delays at airports. I quantified the impact of operational uncertainties on passenger connections using Singapore Changi International Airport Terminal 4 layout and six month ADS-B data. The proposed passenger centric model, in this study, also advises about reassignment of
gates in a delay disrupted scenario. I found that missed connections can be significantly reduced by operationally maintaining higher turnaround time and minimum connection time at airports.'

Low cost carriers usually operate from no-frills budget terminals which are designed for quick
aircraft turnaround, faster passenger connections with minimal inter-gate passenger transfer times. Such
operations are highly sensitive to factors such as aircraft delays, turnaround time and flight connection time
and may lead to missed connections for self-connecting transfer passengers. In this paper, we propose a
passenger-centric model to analyze the effect of turnaround times, minimum connection times and stochastic
delays on missed connections of self-connecting passengers. We use Singapore Changi International Airport
Terminal 4, which mainly caters to budget/low cost carriers, as a case study to demonstrate the impact of
operational uncertainties on these passenger connections, considering an optimal gate assignment by using
heuristic search for scheduled arrivals. The proposed model also incorporates reassignment of gates in the
disrupted scenario to minimize spatial deviation from the optimized gate assignments. Results show that the
chances of missed connections can be significantly reduced by operationally maintaining higher turnaround
time and minimum connection time and by bringing down delays at the airport. Specifically, by maintaining
the flight turnaround time at 50 min, minimum connection time at 60 min and by containing arrival delays
within 70% of the current delay spread at Terminal 4, transfer passenger missed connections can be prevented
for almost all the flights. The gate assignment method adopted in this study is generic and may help to identify
the gates, which are more prone to missed connections given operational uncertainties under different flight
scenarios.
