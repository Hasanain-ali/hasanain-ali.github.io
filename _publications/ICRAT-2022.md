excerpt: 'Although DM implementation can contain airside congestion,
it may adversely impact scheduled gate assignments. Using
an integrated landside airside framework, this study aimed at
evaluating the impact of DM on flight and passenger connections.
Using Singapore Changi airport A-SMGCS data, as a case study,
it is found that DM may transfers as much as 12 minutes of
waiting time from taxiways to gates. This leads to increased gate
conflicts which additionally delays the gate-in time of an arriving
aircraft by 2-7 minutes on average. Gate reassignments were
found to significantly reduce both the number of gate conflicts
and the time an arrival must wait on the apron before parking
at the gate. Through extensive simulations, given the existing
uncertainties at Singapore Changi airport terminal 4, an MCT
of 70 minutes is found sufficient to reduce the probability of
missed connections. As a next step, connections aware departure
metering policies will be developed for Singapore Changi airport
with an aim to optimize the trade-off between taxi-delays (on
airside) and missed connections (on landside). Moreover, impact
of operational constraints like emergency landings, ground delay
program etc., on passenger connectivity shall also be investigated.'

Airport departure metering can contain airside congestion but it may adversely impact scheduled gate assignments leading to passenger missed connections. Using an integrated landside airside framework, this study aims at evaluating the impact of departure metering on connecting flights and passenger connections. The proposed framework comprises of landside and airside simulators where the landside simulator simulates transfer passenger movements conditioned upon minimum connection time and the airside simulator simulates runway and taxiway movements based on planned operations and available data source. Departing aircraft movements are then metered to reduce taxi and take-off delays under uncertainties. Delayed arrivals and/or departures may lead to conflicts at gate rendering planned gate assignments infeasible or impractical. Using Singapore Changi airport A-SMGCS data, as a case study, it is found that DM may transfer as much as 12 minutes of waiting time from taxiways to gates. This leads to increased gate conflicts which additionally delays the gate-in time of an arriving aircraft by 2-7 minutes on average. Gate reassignments were found to significantly reduce both the number of gate conflicts and arrival queuing time at gates leading to less passenger delays. A minimum connection time of 70 minutes is found sufficient to reduce the probability of missed connections for transfer passengers.
